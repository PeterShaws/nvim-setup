# My _ongoing_ NeoVim Setup 2.0

This time using Lazy instead of Packer, because the modularized plugin setup is
clearly superior.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PeterShaws/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

2. `cd` into `~/.config/nvim`
3. Launch NeoVim and wait for Lazy's UI to appear, then wait for it to sync all
plugins
6. You should be good to go; if not, relaunch NeoVim

## Dependencies

1. `nodejs`/`npm`
2. `lazygit`
