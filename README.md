# My _ongoing_ NeoVim Setup 2.0

This time using Lazy instead of Packer, because the modularized plugin setup is
clearly superior.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PeterShaws/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
2. `cd` into `~/.config/nvim`
3. Launch NeoVim
4. Wait for Lazy's UI to appear, then quit NeoVim
5. Launch NeoVim again and wait for Lazy to sync all plugins
6. Relaunch NeoVim and hope for the best
